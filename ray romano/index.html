            <p>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But <br>we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"</p><br>

            <h2>Donna and Scott:  <i>Rescued Renovation</i></h2><br>
            <p>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know <br>it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"</p><br>

            <h2>David Siegel:  <i>Doubled the Value</i></h2><br>
            <p>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his <br>gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home improvements."</p>
